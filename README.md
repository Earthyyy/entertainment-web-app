## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Declarative routing for React
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Toolset for efficient Redux development
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend build tool



### What I learned

This was my first time using TailwindCSS and I really enjoyed it. I was able to get a lot of things done quickly and easily. I also learned how to use React Router and Redux Toolkit. 



### Difficulties

Despite putting significant effort and experimenting with various approaches, I faced challenges while implementing the overflow property to enable both horizontal and vertical scrolling for the trending and recommended sections. Although I eventually found a solution, I remain dissatisfied with the final outcome and would like to explore more efficient methods to accomplish this feature.
